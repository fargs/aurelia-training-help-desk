- Routes in a separate file. src/shell/routes.js to keep the shell clean
- Loading data is left to the routed to pages rather than the visual pieces of the screen. activity-list is an example of this.

- Third party libraries are either referenced in index.html or via the module system. Depends how the library is built.
